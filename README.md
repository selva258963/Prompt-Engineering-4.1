## 4. Prompt Engineering Methodology

### 4.1 Trip Planning (Zero-shot & Few-shot)

#### Zero-Shot Example  
**Prompt:**  
```markdown
"Suggest a 3-day itinerary for Istanbul, balancing history and street food."
```
**Output:**  
```markdown
"Day 1: Hagia Sophia + Grand Bazaar kebabs."  
"Day 2: Topkapi Palace + Baklava tasting."  
"Day 3: Bosphorus cruise + Ortaköy waffles."
```

#### Few-Shot Example
**Prompt:**  
```markdown
1. "Plan a luxury 2-day Paris trip with private tours."  
2. "Plan a budget 5-day Thailand trip with hostels."
```
**Output:**  
```markdown
"Day 1: Ubud yoga class → Organic café."
"Day 2: Sacred Monkey Forest → Spa retreat."  
"Day 3: Campuhan Ridge hike → Vegan dinner."  
"Day 4: Water temple visit → Meditation session."
```

### 4.2 Real-Time Assistance (Chain-of-Thought)
**Prompt:**
```markdown
""My train from Milan to Venice was canceled due to a strike. I have a hotel booked in Venice tonight. What should I do?""
"""Find me a bus departing within 2 hours.""

"CoT Output:
1. Verify cancellation: Check Trenitalia app for alerts.
2. Alternative routes: Look for buses (FlixBus) or BlaBlaCar rideshares.
3. Accommodation: Contact Venice hotel to explain delay; request late check-in.
4. Contingency: If stranded, book last-minute Milan hotel via Booking.com."
```
**Output:**
```markdown
"Next FlixBus departs at 15:30 from Lampugnano station. Tickets: €22. [Link]"
```

### 4.3 Cultural Guidance (Role-Based Prompting)
**Prompt:**
```markdown
"Act as a Tokyo local. Teach me how to use public transport politely."
```
**Output:**
```markdown
1. Queue in marked lines.  
2. Silence phones.  
3. Offer seats to elderly.  
4. Avoid eating/drinking.  
5. Say ‘sumimasen’ (excuse me) when exiting crowded trains.
```

### 4.4 Multi-Modal Interaction
**Prompt:**
```markdown
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6869459-f64c-4882-b4c0-4a0176e19ff9)

"Where is this? Suggest similar less-crowded alternatives."
```
**Output:**
```markdown
"This is Angkor Wat, Cambodia. Try these quieter options:  
- Beng Mealea (jungle-covered ruins).  
- Preah Vihear (mountain-top temple).  
[Image carousel with comparisons]"
```

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric               | Tool/Method                     | Score          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| **Relevance**        | Human Evaluation (1-5)          | 4.7           |
| **Personalization**  | A/B Testing (Itinerary Variants)| 89% Preference|
| **Cultural Accuracy**| Expert Review (vs. Guidebooks)  | 93%           |
| **Multi-Modal Accuracy** | Image/Text Matching Test    | 87%           |


## 6. Results & Observations

- **Few-shot > Zero-shot** for complex queries (e.g., multi-city trips)  
- **Role-based prompts** reduced cultural faux pas by 62% in user tests  
- **Image prompts** improved engagement (avg. session time +3.2 mins)  

7. Limitations & Future Scope
| Limitation                                | Mitigation Strategy                     |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| Vague prompts lead to generic replies     | Implement clarification sub-prompts     |
| Voice recognition in noisy environments   | Noise-canceling Whisper API integration |
| Limited real-time data                    | AccuWeather API partnership             |
